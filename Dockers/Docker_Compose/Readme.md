Certainly! Here's a brief summary of what we did:

1. **Dockerfile for Frontend:**
   - Created a Dockerfile for the frontend using the lightweight Nginx Alpine image.
   - Set the working directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
   - Copied the entire frontend directory into the container.
   - Exposed port 80 for external access.
   - Set the command to start Nginx and run it in the foreground.

2. **Dockerfile for Backend:**
   - Created a Dockerfile for the backend using the Ubuntu image.
   - Set the working directory to `/app`.
   - Copied the entire backend directory into the container.

3. **Docker Compose YAML:**
   - Defined two services, `frontend` and `backend`, each built from their respective Dockerfiles.
   - Specified a common network (`mynetwork`) for both services to communicate.
   - Exposed port 80 for the frontend service to allow external access.

4. **Building and Running:**
   - Used `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the containers.
   - Checked the logs to ensure both containers were running.

5. **Accessing the Application:**
   - Accessed the frontend application through the browser at `http://localhost`.

"While working in the backend container, I'm trying to access the `index.html` file stored in the frontend container. This seamless access is made possible through the utilization of a shared volume. Specifically, we established a Docker volume named `frontend-volume` that is mounted in both the frontend and backend services. This volume serves as a shared space for data exchange between the containers.

In addition to volume sharing, Docker networking plays a crucial role. Both the frontend and backend services are connected to a common Docker network named `mynetwork`. This network facilitates smooth communication between the services using their designated service names (`frontend` and `backend`), enhancing the overall coordination of the application components."
