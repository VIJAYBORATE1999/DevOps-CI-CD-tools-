Concept of Users  
    • Root (Have all persmisson) It has complete administrative access to all AWS services and resources within the account. 
    • IAM(have custom permissions )are separate identities with customizable permissions within an AWS account using IAM policies.IAM users can be granted permissions that allow them to perform some actions that are typically associated with the root account, but they do not inherently have the same level of control and access as the root account.IAM users cannot access certain sensitive account information or perform actions that are exclusive to the root account.
