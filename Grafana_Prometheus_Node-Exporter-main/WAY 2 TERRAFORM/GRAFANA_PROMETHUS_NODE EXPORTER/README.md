<H2>WHERE WE WILL PERFORM THE SAME TASK BY TERRAFORM RESOURCES  </H2> <BR>
<H3>WE CAN USE TERRFAROM ==> <BR> 1)provisioner "remote-exec"   ==> MAIN.TF <BR>
2) user_data  ==> MAIN2.TF </H3> <BR>

 Here's a concise differentiation between `user_data` and `provisioner "remote-exec"` in Terraform:<BR>

- **`user_data`:**
  - **Use Case:** Simple, one-time initialization tasks during instance launch.
  - **Timing:** Executes during the launch of the instance.
  - **Scope:** Specific to EC2 instances.
  - **Advantage:** Simplicity and ease of use for basic configuration.

- **`provisioner "remote-exec"`:**
  - **Use Case:** More complex configuration, post-launch tasks, and greater flexibility in script execution.
  - **Timing:** Executes after the instance has been launched.
  - **Scope:** Can be used with various resources, not limited to EC2 instances.
  - **Advantage:** Flexibility, control over script execution timing, and suitability for post-launch configuration tasks.
