EC2 service 
Elastic Cloud Compute : Provides you a virtual server .
Compute instance : privides you CPU , RAM , Disk .
Elastic : Service can be Scaled up or down.

Here are the main five types of Amazon EC2 instances described : 
    1 General Purpose Instances: Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources for diverse workloads.
    2 Compute Optimized Instances: High-performance processors for compute-bound applications, ideal for batch processing and high-performance web servers.
    3 Memory Optimized Instances: Fast performance for memory-intensive workloads, suitable for high-performance databases and real-time big data analytics.
    4 Storage Optimized Instances: Designed for high, sequential read/write access to large data sets, perfect for data warehousing and log processing applications.
    5 Accelerated Computing Instances: Hardware accelerators for efficient processing of tasks such as machine learning and computational fluid dynamics
